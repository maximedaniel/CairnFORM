# CairnFORM

Inspired by _cairns_, CairnFORM is a shape-changing cylindrical display that simultaneously inform users at 360Â° using color-changing and shape-changing abilities. We use CairnFORM for visualizing and announcing variations of local renewable energy production. We deployed CairnFORM in the middle of an open plan for helping employees to shift laptop battery charge to peak hours of local renewable energy production (i.e. promoting energy cleanliness).

CairnFORM is built as a stack of expandable illuminated rings.
